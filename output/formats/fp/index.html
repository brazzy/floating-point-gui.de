		<h1>Floating Point Numbers</h1>
      
<h2 id="why-floating-point-numbers-are-needed">Why floating-point numbers are needed</h2>

<p>Since computer memory is limited, you cannot store numbers with infinite precision, no matter whether you use <a href="/formats/binary/">binary fractions</a> or decimal ones: at some point you have to cut off. But how much accuracy is needed? And <em>where</em> is it needed? How many integer digits and how many fraction digits?</p>

<ul>
  <li>To an engineer building a highway, it does not matter whether it’s 10 meters or 10.0001 meters wide - their measurements are probably not that accurate in the first place.</li>
  <li>To someone designing a microchip, 0.0001 meters (a tenth of a millimeter) is a <em>huge</em> difference - But they’ll never have to deal with a distance larger than 0.1 meters.</li>
  <li>A physicist needs to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light">speed of light</a> (about 300000000) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant">Newton’s gravitational constant</a> (about 0.0000000000667) together in the same calculation.</li>
</ul>

<p>To satisfy the engineer and the chip designer, a number format has to provide accuracy for numbers at very different magnitudes. However, only <em>relative</em> accuracy is needed. To satisfy the physicist, it must be possible to do calculations that involve numbers with different magnitudes.</p>

<p>Basically, having a fixed number of integer and fractional digits is not useful - and the solution is a format with a <em>floating point</em>.</p>

<h2 id="how-floating-point-numbers-work">How floating-point numbers work</h2>
<p>The idea is to compose a number of two main parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>significand</strong> that contains the number’s digits. Negative significands represent negative numbers.</li>
  <li>An <strong>exponent</strong> that says where the decimal (or binary) point is placed relative to the beginning of the significand. Negative exponents represent numbers that are very small (i.e. close to zero).</li>
</ul>

<p>Such a format satisfies all the requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It can represent numbers at wildly different magnitudes (limited by the length of the exponent)</li>
  <li>It provides the same relative accuracy at all magnitudes (limited by the length of the significand)</li>
  <li>It allows calculations across magnitudes: multiplying a very large and a very small number preserves the accuracy of both in the result.</li>
</ul>

<p>Decimal floating-point numbers usually take the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation">scientific notation</a> with an
explicit point always between the 1st and 2nd digits. The exponent is
either written explicitly including the base, or an <strong>e</strong> is used to
separate it from the significand.</p>

<h2 id="the-standard">The standard</h2>
<p>Nearly all hardware and programming languages use floating-point numbers in the same binary formats, which are defined in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008">IEEE 754</a> standard. The usual formats are 32 or 64 bits in total length:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Format</th>
      <th>Total bits</th>
      <th>Significand bits</th>
      <th>Exponent bits</th>
      <th>Smallest number</th>
      <th>Largest number</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Single precision</td>
      <td>32</td>
      <td>23 + 1 sign</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>ca. 1.2 ⋅ 10<sup>-38</sup></td>
      <td>ca. 3.4 ⋅ 10<sup>38</sup></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Double precision</td>
      <td>64</td>
      <td>52 + 1 sign</td>
      <td>11</td>
      <td>ca. 2.2 ⋅ 10<sup>-308</sup></td>
      <td>ca. 1.8 ⋅ 10<sup>308</sup></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that there are some peculiarities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>actual bit sequence</strong> is the sign bit first, followed by the exponent and finally the significand bits.</li>
  <li>The exponent does not have a sign; instead an <strong>exponent bias</strong> is subtracted from it (127 for single and 1023 for double precision). This, and the bit sequence, allows floating-point numbers to be compared and sorted correctly even when interpreting them as integers.</li>
  <li>The significand’s most significant digit is omitted and assumed to be 1, except for <strong>subnormal numbers</strong> which are marked by an all-0 exponent and allow a number range beyond the smallest numbers given in the table above, at the cost of precision.</li>
  <li>There are separate <strong>positive and a negative zero</strong> values, differing in the sign bit, where all other bits are 0. These must be considered equal even though their bit patterns are different.</li>
  <li>There are special <strong>positive and negative infinity</strong> values, where the exponent is all 1-bits and the significand is all 0-bits. These are the results of calculations where the positive range of the exponent is exceeded, or division  of a regular number by zero.</li>
  <li>There are special <strong>not a number</strong> (or NaN) values where the exponent is all 1-bits and the significand is <em>not</em> all 0-bits. These represent the result of various undefined calculations (like multiplying 0 and infinity, any calculation involving a NaN value, or application-specific cases). Even bit-identical NaN values must <em>not</em> be considered equal.</li>
</ul>
