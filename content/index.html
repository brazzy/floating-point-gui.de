title: What Every Programmer Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic
description: Aims to provide both short and simple answers to the common recurring questions of novice programmers about floating-point numbers not 'adding up' correctly, and more in-depth information about how IEEE 754 floats work, when and how to use them correctly, and what to use instead when they are not appropriate.

Why don't my numbers add up?
============================

So you've written some absurdly simple code, say for example:

		0.1 + 0.2

and got a really unexpected result:

		0.30000000000000004

Maybe you asked for help on some forum and got pointed to a [long article with lots of formulas](http://cr.yp.to/2005-590/goldberg.pdf) that didn't seem to help with your problem.

Well, this site is here to:

* Explain concisely why you get that unexpected result
* Tell you how to deal with this problem
* If you're interested, provide in-depth explanations of why floating-point numbers have to work like that and what other problems can arise

You should look at the [Basic Answers](/basic/) first - but don't stop there!
