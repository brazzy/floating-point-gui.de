Floating-Point Types
--------
PHP is dynamically typed and will often convert implicitly between strings and floating-point numbers (which are platform-dependant, but typically IEEE 64 bit values). To force a value to floating-point, evaluate it in a numerical context:
		$foo = 0 + "10.5"; 


Decimal Types
-------------
The BC Math extension implements [arbitrary-precision](/formats/exact/) decimal math:
		$a = '0.1';
		$b = '0.2';
		echo bcadd($a, $b);     // prints 0.3

How to Round
------------
Rounding can be done with the <code>number_format()</code> function:
		$number = 4.123;
		echo number_format($number, 2); // prints 4.12
