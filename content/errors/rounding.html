title: Rounding Errors
---

Because [floating-point numbers](/formats/fp/) have a limited number of digits, they cannot represent all
[real numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number) accurately: when there
are more digits than the format allows, the leftover ones are omitted - the number is
*rounded*. There are three reasons why this can be necessary:

* **Large Denominators**
  In any base, the larger the denominator of an (irreducible) fraction, the more digits it needs in
  positional notation. A sufficiently large denominator will require rounding, no
  matter what the base or number of available digits is. For example, 1/1000
  cannot be accurately represented in less than 3 decimal digits, nor can any
  multiple of it (that does not allow simplifying the fraction).
* **Periodical digits**
  Any (irreducible) fraction where the denominator has a prime factor that does not occur in the base
  requires an infinite number of digits that repeat periodically after a certain point.
  For example, in decimal 1/4, 3/5 and 8/20 are finite, because 2 and 
  5 are the prime factors of 10. But 1/3 is not finite, nor is 2/3 or 1/7 or 5/6, because 3 
  and 7 are not factors of 10. Fractions with a prime factor of 5 in the denominator
  can be finite in base 10, but [not in base 2](/formats/binary/) - the biggest source of confusion for most
  novice users of floating-point numbers.
* **Transcendental numbers**
  Transcendental numbers cannot be represented as a regular fraction at all, and in
  positional notation (no matter what base) they require an infinite number of non-recurring digits.

Rounding modes
--------------
There are different methods to do rounding, and this can be very important in programming,
because rounding can cause different probles in various contexts that can be addressed by
using a better rounding mode. The most common rounding modes are:

* **Rounding towards zero** - simply truncate the extra digits. The
  simplest method, but it introduces larger errors than necessary as well
  as a bias towards zero when dealing with mainly positive or mainly
  negative numbers.
* **Rounding half away from zero** - if the truncated fraction is greater than or equal to half the base,
  increase the last remaining digit. This is the method generally taught in school and used by most
  people. It minimizes errors, but also introduces a bias (away from zero).
* **Rounding half to even** also known as **banker's rounding** - if the truncated fraction is 
  greater than half the base,
  increase the last remaining digit. If it is equal to half the base, increase the digit only
  if it's not even. This minimizes errors and bias, and is therefore preferred for bookkeeping.

Examples in base 10:
|      | Towards zero | Half away from zero | Half to even |
|------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|
|  1.4 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
|  1.5 |  1 |  2 |  2 |
| -1.6 | -1 | -2 | -2 |
|  2.6 |  2 |  3 |  3 |
|  2.5 |  2 |  3 |  2 |
| -2.4 | -2 | -2 |  2 |
  
Note that for [base 2](/formats/binary/), both "rounding half" modes are identical.
