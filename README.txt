floating-point.gui.de aims to provide both short and simple 
answers to the common recurring questions of novice programmers
about floating point numbers not "adding up" correctly, and
more in-depth information about how IEEE 754 floats work,
when and how to use them correctly, and what to use instead
when they are not appropriate.
